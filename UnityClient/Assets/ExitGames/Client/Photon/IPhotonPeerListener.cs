    /// Callback method which gives you (async) responses for called operations.

    /// </summary>
    /// 
    /// <remarks>
    /// Similar to method-calling, operations can have a result.
    ///             Because operation-calls are non-blocking and executed on the server, responses are provided
    ///             after a roundtrip as call to this method.
    /// 
    ///             Example: Trying to create a room usually succeeds but can fail if the room's name is already
    ///             in use (room names are their IDs).
    /// 
    ///             This method is used as general callback for all operations. Each response corresponds to a certain
    ///             "type" of operation by its OperationCode (see: <see cref="!:Operations"/>).
    /// 
    /// <para/>
    /// 
    /// </remarks>
    /// 
    /// <example>
    /// When you join a room, the server will assign a consecutive number to each client: the
    ///             "actorNr" or "player number". This is sent back in the OperationResult's
    ///             Parameters as value of key <see cref="!:EventCode.ActorNr"/>.
    /// <para/>
    /// 
    /// 
    ///             Fetch your actorNr of a Join response like this:
    /// <para/>
    /// <c>int actorNr = (int)operationResponse[(byte)OperationCode.ActorNr];</c>

    /// 
    /// <remarks>
    /// Events are used for communication between clients and allow the server to update clients over time.
    ///             The creation of an event is often triggered by an operation (called by this client or an other).
    /// 
    ///             Each event carries its specific content in its Parameters. Your application knows which content to
    ///             expect by checking the event's 'type', given by the event's Code.
    /// 
    ///             Events can be defined and extended server-side.
    /// 
    ///             If you use the LoadBalancing application as base, several events like EvJoin and EvLeave are already defined.
    ///             For these events and their Parameters, the library provides constants, so check the EventCode and ParameterCode
    ///             classes.
    /// 
    ///             Photon also allows you to come up with custom events on the fly, purely client-side. To do so, use
    ///             OpRaiseEvent.
    /// <para/>
    /// 
    /// 
    ///             Events are buffered on the client side and must be Dispatched. This way, OnEvent is always taking
    ///             place in the same thread as a <see cref="M:ExitGames.Client.Photon.PhotonPeer.DispatchIncomingCommands"/> call.
